# Blink example using arduino framework

This is pretty much an Arduino sketch. It can be compiled using `espmake`: see
[history.rst](../history.rst) file.

Very simple, but a bit of a dead end. I prefer the approach in
[blink-arduino-esp](../blink-arduino-esp) because it uses the esp-idf
framework with Arduino as a component.
